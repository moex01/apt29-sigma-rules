title: Remote DLL Execution via WMIC and WMIPRVSE
id: 83d3000e-31c6-41ba-9083-fbd484c276fb
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects potential malicious remote DLL using WMIC:
  - On the source machine, a command shell (cmd.exe or powershell.exe) executing WMIC with parameters 
    (including "/node:", "call", and "rundll32") indicating remote process creation.
  - On the target machine, a rundll32.exe process that is spawned by WMIPRVSE.exe.
